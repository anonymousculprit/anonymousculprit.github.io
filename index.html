Why is <b>Quantum Physics</b> important to us? <strong>Will we ever know why?</strong> Many might see that Quantum physics is a difficult topic to talk about.
We humans are intimidated by the vast knowledge and the unknown, we are too afraid to approach such deep concepts that could possibly hurt us in the result of
prying into the deep void. Yet when done correctly, we could have the power of <em>god</em> (and anime) on our side. If you're willing to step out of your small little world,
and take on a whole new level of happiness and salvation, continue reading.</font>

<h3 style="color:darkgreen"><font face="Verdana">Not convinced?</h1>
<p><font face="Verdana"></font>Do you know that Quantum Physics is a type of <i>physics?</i> You may have learnt about things like gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy.
Perhaps velocity and speed may have popped into your mind with the reflection of light. But Quantum Physics is about much more than this. We are not constrained to such small topics
and we go further, larger, faster than anyone.(Especially biology. Fuck you biology.) You might be wondering, 'Oh man! Quantum Physics? That sounds so difficult!' Well guess what?
<b>You're absolutely correct.</b> But the complexity and difficulty is what makes Quantum Physics better than all those other shitty scienes.(Screw off robotics)
<br>Because to be fair, you need to have a very high IQ to understand Quantum Physics.</br>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana">
Let us talk more about why it is so important to learn this, <i>"Quantum Physics"</i>. You're thinking, 'Shit m8 what dis binch talkin' I get that, it's totally fine to
be pushed off by this, we get that a lot in our studies. But what I say to those people is that I don't say a thing to them because they won't live to see the sunlight again.

<br>This is a photo of a sun, beautiful isn't it?</br>
Moving on. If you're a true bro, you won't be turned off by such topic of sciences. Real man study sciences. Only the toughest can survive in this world. So if you got the nerve,
you'd take this lesson seriously. Of course, this logic only applies to fragile boys trying to maintain their man ego, so if this doesn't convince you, we'll talk more.
